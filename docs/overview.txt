# Serializable classes

Note: All these classes are read-only (thus contain no public setters). This makes it safe to make them serializable and send them around.

## ReservationConstrains
The user can select constraints so these need to be send to the server.

## CarType
The user can ask for certain CarTypes (eg. the available ones) at several occasions. So these need to be send over to the client. It's a nicer design sending over CarType, rather than just a string (the name).

## Quote
The user can request his current quotes, so these need to be send over to the client.
